<p><a class="internal" href="../../wp/s/South_Africa_A.htm">South Africa</a> has one of the highest incidences of HIV / AIDS at 18.8% of the adult population. In addition it is estimated that there are over 1.2 million AIDS orphans, which is half of all orphans.</p>
<p>SOS Children has worked specifically on projects supporting families affected by HIV / AIDS since January 2002 based on its eight SOS Children's Villages. These are termed &#x2018;Family Strengthening Programmes&#x2019;, as they increase the ability of a vulnerable family to care for their child and thus prevent child abandonment and family breakup.</p>
<h2>SOS Children in South Africa<br /></h2>
<img class="image-right" src="../../wp/s/SouthAfricaMthathaSmall.jpg" alt="sponsor a child in south africa: FSP Mthatha" />
<p><strong>Mamelodi</strong>: 350 children and their families affected by the AIDS pandemic in Mamelodi, Pretoria, receive direct support with their educational, medical and food needs. Key areas include HIV / AIDS prevention/awareness campaigns, and counselling on how to live with HIV / AIDS. The little children are also given scholarships to attend the SOS Nursery School in Mamelodi. Community Vegetable Gardens have been set up and carers taught how to tend to the vegetables; having a sustainable source of healthy food is particularly important during the current global food crisis.</p>
<p><strong>Ennerdale</strong>: As well as the community support programme near Johannesburg where support and assistance (food-parcels, clothing, education, counselling, medical care, income-generating activities) are given to 350 children/families affected by HIV / AIDS, other activities include:<br /><br />   -Youth Arts and Cultural Programme - an HIV Drama presented three times a week</p>
<p>-PLWHA (People Living With HIV / AIDS) Support Group - counselling, support, food</p>
<p>-Young Mothers&#x2019; Support Group - personal hygiene, how to care for a baby, breastfeeding</p>
<p>-Behavioural Change Programme - sexuality, use of condoms and abstention.<br /></p>
<p><strong>Cape Town</strong>: The programme supports 90 needy families in the Langa Township and works in conjunction with local community organisations. The programme includes: parental training forcarers, training on income-generating activities, payment of tuition for school children, ongoing counselling support to the children/families, medical support for ill children, food parcels and basic clothing.</p>
<p><strong>Port Elizabeth</strong>: The Family Strengthening Progranmme works in the Walmer Township close to the SOS Children's Village, in partnership with community based organisations (CBOs). The 170 beneficiaries of the programme receive food-parcels, clothing, help with school fees and medical care. In the Missionvale community SOS Children's Villages is helping to improve the nursery school. Regular home visits take place to monitor the conditions of the families.  The caregivers visit their area clinics and to make use of anti-retroviral medicine, drugs which slow the progression of HIV to AIDS.</p>
<p><strong>Pietermaritzburg</strong>: The Community Programme, working with the Department of Social Welfare, supports 200 AIDS-affected families in the France and Slangspruit communities by providing monthly food parcels, counselling, clothing, school fees and uniforms, and food for infants who are HIV positive. In addition, caregivers from HIV / AIDS-affected families are given basic sewing and business management skills, additionally they are provided with lunch and bus fare on a day-to-day basis. The main aim is to help them to start their own small businesses in their communities. The third part of the community programme currently helps six local nursery schools - teaching materials, food, building work.</p>
<p><strong>Nelspruit</strong>: The Family Strengthening Programme in Nelspruit, north-eastern <a class="internal" href="../../wp/s/South_Africa_A.htm">South Africa</a>, supports 788 children in 436 families. Activities include material support and income-generation projects such as bead work projects and vegetable production.

<p><strong>Mthatha</strong>: SOS Children's Villages is working with the local hospice in south-eastern South Africa to help 350 families and their children who are affected by HIV / AIDS. This includes clothing, food and blankets, school fees and uniforms, income-generating possibilities as well as emotional support. In addition the SOS Social Centre in Mthatha is running an HIV / AIDS Information and Resource Centre, working with an HIV / AIDS support group. Workshops are organised in local schools on HIV / AIDS awareness and sexuality. Secondary school students, who are HIV positive, are given referrals and support.</p>
<p><strong>Qwa Qwa</strong>: The Family Strengthening Programme in this former &#x2018;homeland&#x2019;  provides health and education services to AIDS-affected families with vulnerable children, and is currently supporting 258 children in 68 families. The direct delivery of services, as well as the scheduled family support visits, are carried out by 15 volunteers. The vulnerable families are supported in setting up an income-generating or livelihood  project in order to ensure self-sufficiency. While the project is developing, a safety net comprising a food parcel and scholarship support is given in order to ensure that children are not deprived of their right to education and nutrition. Many families are also assisted with accessing government social welfare grants.</p>
<p><strong>Rustenburg</strong>:  At the end of October 2008, a new Family Strengthening Programme began in Rustenburg, a town in the country&#x2019;s north and the location of our newest South African Children&#x2019;s Village.453 children from 155 families, the majority of who are AIDS-affected, benefit from food parcels, schooling and income-generation support. A food gardening project will begin in 2009.</p>
