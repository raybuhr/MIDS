<h3><img class="image-left" src="../../wp/i/_EWImage_preview" alt="Children at Byumba, Rwanda" />SOS Children's Village Byumba</h3>
SOS Children's Village Byumba has been open since 4 October 1997. It is 
in the north of <a title="SOS Children in Rwanda" class="internal-link" href="../../wp/s/Sos_Children_In_Rwanda.htm">Rwanda</a>,
 about 7 km outside of the town of the same name and about 60 km north 
of <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/c/Child_Sponsorship_Background_From_Kigali_Rwanda.htm">Kigali</a>.
 Byumba can be reached relatively easily via the well-built main road; 
the nearest airport is in the capital city. As SOS Children's Village 
Byumba, which was not opened officially until 27 April 1999, is located 
at a relatively high altitude, it is always pleasantly cool. It includes
 15 family houses for 150 children, administration 
buildings, a common room, a village director's house, an aunt's house, 
workshops as well as a volley ball and basketball court.
<h3>Other SOS Projects in Byumba</h3>
<p>Since there are no childcare facilities near to the SOS Children's 
Village and the village school was destroyed
 during the civil war, an SOS Nursery School and an <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/s/Sos_Schools.htm">SOS Primary School</a> 
were added to the Byumba location, which both opened their gates on 13 
October 1997. Seventy-five children aged three to six (also those from 
neighbouring areas) can be cared for in the SOS Nursery School, in which
 three group rooms, a multi-purpose hall, a library, a kitchen and an 
office for the director available for the SOS aunts. 420 pupils (some of
 whom are from the neighbouring area) are taught in 12 classes at the 
SOS Primary School. A staff room is available for the teachers and the 
library is very popular with the pupils.</p>
<p>In just a short space of time, the SOS Children's Village Byumba had 
become an essential part of its neighbourhood in every respect. It 
became even more important when an <a class="external-link" href="../../wp/r/Rwanda_C.htm">SOS Medical 
Centre</a> was also opened in February 1999, which has ensured health 
care for them since then. Around 4,500 people use the small clinic 
yearly, which in addition to a treatment and a check-up room, contains a
 laboratory and a dispensary.</p>
<p>To encourage young people who are reaching adulthood to become even 
more independent, an SOS Youth Home was also finally opened for them
 in September 2001.&nbsp; This project consists of two shared flats for boys 
and one for girls. A total of 42 young people are encouraged to show 
their own initiative more and more; only a caregiver looks after them 
and they have to become increasingly independent. The SOS mother, the 
village director and psychologists thoroughly prepare the young people 
for admission to the SOS Youth Home, where they stay for about four
 years. However, those young people who are still being educated or who 
are looking for a job stay longer.</p>
