<p><strong>SOS Nursery School Gorazde</strong></p>
<p><img class="image-right" src="../../wp/i/_QNImage_preview" alt="Children at the SOS Nursery School, Gorazde, Bosnia Herzegovenia" />Workshops with
parents continuously are the part of our tradition which we try to enrich by
broadening activities. We learn form parents and children and develop our
activities in accordance with their needs.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Our workshops are something we will
keep and chary as a cornerstone and basis for planning our activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to educational
activates this year we were focusing also on different classes or/and services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were
offering the following education programs for kids:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li style="text-align: justify;">Primary education program for
     children ages 3-7 years;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Short, specialized programs for
     early learning English language, early music education and early training
     for using computer.</li></ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;Apart
from these programs, the nursery school was providing another kind of services
for the kids:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li style="text-align: justify;">Pediatrician and a dentist are
     caring for their health and&nbsp; healthy
     teeth, two times a week</li><li>Speech
     pathologist is helping children to develop correct speech, two times
     weekly</li></ul>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;Playrooms were also one of the important activities,
implemented by Family Strengthening Programme team, and supported by the
Government of Gorazde Canton.</p>
<p>With a wish to share joy and benefits
that this preschool offers, there are playrooms for preschool
children organised in all primary school buildings in Gora&#x17E;de. In the
playrooms, these short programs take place two times a week, three hours per
session, for 170 children.</p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>SOS Nursery School Mostar</strong></p>
<p><img class="image-left" src="../../wp/i/_AEFImage_preview" alt="Children at the SOS Nursery School Mostar, Bosnia Herzegovenia" />We
can mark 2008 as a successful and exciting year.</p>
<p>This
year we celebrated 10 year anniversary of the SOS Nursery School in March and in May 2008
we officially opened SOS Family Centre in Mostar.</p>
<p>We
work with the full capacity of the nursery school. Six children from the Welfare
Social Centre were accommodated in the nursery school free of charge until July 2008. With the beginning of the new school year we arranged for 3 children from
Family Centre to be accommodated at the nursery school, but also 1 child from the
local orphanage and 1 child from socially deprived family. We find local
sponsors for these children within the community. <img class="image-right" src="../../wp/i/_BLImage_preview" alt="Child at the SOS Nursery School Mostar, Bosnia Herzegovenia" /></p>
<p>The
Ministry of Education of Herzegovina-Neretva Canton accepted our drafts of
education documentation for preschool education and maid it official and
obligatory for all nursery schools in the Canton
from September 2008.</p>
<p>Beside
regular educational programme, we offer different activities for children &#x2013;
lessons of English language, music lessons and speech therapist. The students
of International gymnasium are working with children on weekly basis offering
physical education workshops.</p>
<p>It
is important to mention that the nursery school continuously stayed open whole
year, without summer and winter holiday breaks.</p>
<p>For
project <em>&#x201C;Playrooms on Whiles&#x201D;</em> we signed the contract with the group of Italian
nongovernmental organisations Educaid, Peace games and Peace race. They will be
our official partner with participation of 12.000,00 Euros. The contract ends
in May 2009. By the end of 2008 the number of children attending playrooms grew
to 300. We are covering 11 locations within the region of Mostar and have 13
groups of children. Local government participated with 500,00 KM for this
project in 2008.</p>
<p>Staff
news:</p>
<p>-
Medical nurse retired with the end of 2008 and we employed new person.</p>
<p>-
4 nursery school teachers continued their further education at local university.</p>
<p>-
1 teacher became advisor for preschool education for Educational Institute of
Mostar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SOS Nursery School <a class="external-link" href="http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/charity-news/sarajevo-2008-update.htm">Sarajevo</a></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class="image-left" src="../../wp/i/_SVImage_preview" alt="Drawing by child at the SOS Nursery School Sarajevo, Bosnia Herzegovenia" />The
most significant fact during this period was registration of the nursery school in
Kantonal Ministry of education, in November 2008. From then, parents can apply
to the Ministry of education to obtain
different kind of subsidies for their children. Unfortinately, there's no
possibility for nursery schools to apply for any kind of subsidies for particular
child or group of children as such it is regulated&nbsp; by new Preschool low in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
But, we will try to advocate for children from our target groups (those target
groups are similar to some other nursery schools, too) in collaboration with
other nursery schools, except those from public sector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's
an active and demanding period in front of us regarding&nbsp; at least two things:</p>
<p>-
to develop an operation plan for allignment of&nbsp;
SOS Nursery School to the SOS Children Formal education policy in 2009,</p>
<p>-
to make more proactive approach to Kantonal educational authorities in order to
influence on them (in regard to our adjusted approach in Nursery Schools) to
give us more understanding and financial support for conducting our programmes.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">There was
not a big change in the number of children in nursery school again this year, but
our capacity is full. Average number of children in the nursery school remained
almost the same because our capacities are full up to &#x201C;last seat&#x201D; since the
beginning of September 2008, when new school year started. The group of
children attending the speech therapy become well recognized and supported,
last year again in 100% by government, companies, citizens.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">The income
of parents payment was nearly 99%, which was unexpected, so the income rate
increased in 10% in comparison to the last year.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Good news is
constitution of Council of parents in the Nursery School which can help us in
conducting the programmes and play a good role in promoting our work in the
society.</p>
