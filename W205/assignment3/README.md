##MIDS W205-3, Ray Buhr

###Task 1: Storing task
Store twitter data regarding #minecraft or #mojang 
(*important-#minecraft and not #microsoft, due to my error in assignment 2)

###Task 2: Retrieving and Analyzing Task

###Task 3: Storing and Retrieving Task

###What to Turn In
- 1.  A link to your S3 bucket that holds the backups documented in your README.md file. Make sure to make it publicly accessible.

- 2.  Your python codes.

Python codes are names of the task, i.e. task 1.1 is 1.1_storing_db_streamT.py

- 3.  The plot of your lexical diversity in task 2.2

I plotted lexical dispersion for the corpus of tweets over the 10 most common English words:
